# hotel_bookings
This contains my first EDA with Python on a dataset of hotel bookings from kaggle, link provided below<br>
I made a <i>rough</i> DL model to predict the cancellation of a booking<br>
It showed high validation accuracy at first try itself, maybe the dataset was <i>too clean</i><br>
The graphs analysing the data can be found inside the notebook<br>
